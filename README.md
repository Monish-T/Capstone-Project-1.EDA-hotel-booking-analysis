# Capstone-Project-1.EDA-hotel-booking-analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) project involved analyzing a dataset on hotel bookings and cancellations. The aim of the project was to gain insights Using statistics and visualizations to and identify trends that influence in Hotel Bookings for year 2015-2017. The project followed a step-by-step approach to perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis on the dataset.

# The univariate analysis
involved analyzing individual variables in the dataset.This helped analyze trends like most preferred hotel, Average cancellation rate, most preferred meal with stay, Most bookings are from which place and many more.

# The bivariate analysis
involved examining the relationship between two variables in the dataset. This helped in identifying any association between the variables. This helped in understanding trends like-
Bookings and cancelation received by different hotel types,
Monthly trend analysis of Booking for different  hotel types,
Average ADR Vs Total Stay Analses ,
Cancelation of bookings Vs Customer special request rate Analyses,
Cancelation of bookings by Different market segment Analyses,
Lead time vs booking for different hotel types,
Country wise analysis of cancellations,

# The multivariate analysis
involved examining the relationship between multiple variables in the dataset. This helped in identifying any complex interactions between the variables like -
Monthly trend analyses of bookings and cancellation received by
different hotel types,
Market Segment wise trend analyses of bookings and cancellation received by Portugal vs Other Countries,
Agent/Operator wise trend analyses of bookings and cancellation received by Portugal vs Other Countries,
Average ADR wise trend analyses of bookings by agents and Bookings VS cancellation received by Top Agents. 


The results of the analysis revealed several interesting insights into the factors that influence hotel bookings and cancellations. For instance, the analysis showed that City Hotels Receive twice the number of bookings received by Resort Hotels, 1 out of 3 Bookings gets cancelled, Bookings with special request have only 20% chance of cancellation. On the other hand bookings without any special request have higher chances of cancellation around 50%, adn many more.

Overall, the EDA project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence hotel bookings and cancellations, which could be used by hotels to improve their revenue management strategies and also avoid higher cancellations in future. The project also demonstrated the importance of performing EDA to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify patterns and trends that can inform decision-making.
